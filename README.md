Sweetp service to manage project context.

# Usage

You have to create the DB in your ArangoDB server named `sweetp` or configure another DB.

## Configuration

Configure DB by command line switch, e.g. `--dbConnection http://myotherhost:1234/sweetp-database`.

Enabled logging with `DEBUG=project-context-manager:* node ...` environment
variable. Set this (or other) environment variables before running sweetp
server to enable loging in production.

# Development

Create DB 'sweetpUnittest' for tests.

You want to clone and link
